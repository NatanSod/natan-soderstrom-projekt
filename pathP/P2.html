          Sta- I mean Space Battle! Yeah! Look at that shitty logo made in
          Microsoft Paint! It's so bad! I love it! Also the large pixel size is
          a style choice, it's going to be present in the proper version (Unless
          something incredibly unlikely happens, like me learning how to draw
          somethign that isn't pixel art) except it will look much better
          becasuse I will spend more than 5 minutes drawing the image, and if
          you change the window size then you might notice that there is no
          smuding of the pixels, leaving the image crisp no matter what you do.

          Also I lied earlier, there will be more boring stuff, I'm now going to
          explain what's going on: In this prolouge thing you will be a space
          person in the finall battle against the greatest evil in the galaxy:
          The Badmen, lead by a man who's name strikes fear into anyone who
          hears it: Tod. In this mission you will get to make some choices which
          will effect the story's outcome. Now, enough booring stuff, for real
          this time (or is it?).
