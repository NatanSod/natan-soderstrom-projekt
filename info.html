      <h2>About the author:</h2>
      <p>
        I, the writer, am a teenage boy, and that is all I'm comfortable saying
        about that. I wrote this story for an assignment in web development.
        While the story isn't getting me a grade, the idea of telling this story
        is what truly motivates me, so I hope you'll give it a chance.
      </p>
      <h2>About the story:</h2>
      <p>
        "Welcome to: <strong style="color: orange">Wadalond</strong>" is a
        choose-your-own-adventure webcomic about a person who leads quite a
        booring life escaping the struggle of the real world by creating more
        interesting worlds and exploring them in their very vivid dreams. Though
        maybe the dreams are a bit
        <a

          too vivid

        . You, the reader, will, at certain points in the story, be able to make
        some choices that will change the course of the story. Don't worry about
        the choices too much, you can always go back.

      <h2>Things that are good to know:</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>The bookmark feature:</strong> Once you start reading you will
        see two buttons at the bottom of the page. One that says "Save Page" and
        one that says "Load Page". These are used to create a sort of bookmark.
        Pressing "Save Page" will make the website save which page you're
        currently on, and pressing "Load Page" will take you to the saved page
        if you have one.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Special pages:</strong> Some pages have special things going on,
        like stuff that moves. In case these things don't work or you just can't
        see them, there will be a link at the top of the page that takes you to
        a "normal" version of the page. So why do I make special pages when I'm
        also making them as normal pages? Because it's cooler!
