              I can see it now; vast fields of green, a farm here, a tiny
              village there. A place with no worries, where you can be content
              simply watching the world go by. A great introduction to this
              world and a fantastic spot to start an adventure. A bit standard,
              but it’s a standard for a reason.
            </p>
            <p id="1-1-2" class="intextholder">
              Now I just need to decide what role I will play.
            </p>

            <p id="1-2-1" class="intextholder">
              Ah yes, the harsh, unforgiving cold of the winter waste land.
              Where few things grow and the only people that go there are
              researchers looking for the secrets of this untamed land of frost.
            </p>
            <p id="1-2-2" class="intextholder">
              A good choice, but what position shall I take in this story?
            </p>

            <p id="1-3-1" class="intextholder">
              Warm, huh… would have a volcano or two, be pretty close to the sea
              and… I know! A kingdom that puts a lot of value in physical
              strength and tradition. Where the highest ranking members of
              society, except for the rulers, are soldiers. There’s probably a
              lot of civil unrest, and some corruption going on behind the
              scenes. This is going to get interesting!
            </p>
            <p id="1-3-2" class="intextholder">
              But should I be a pawn or a player in this game of politics?
            </p>

            <p id="1-4-1" class="intextholder">
              The vast sea of yellow sand that goes as far as the eye can see,
              where the hot sun burns anything it touches, making water and
              shade a rare privilege. Many travel this harsh land in search of
              adventure and coin, and some find refuge near rivers; the cradles
              of civilization.
            </p>
            <p id="1-4-2" class="intextholder">
              But who am I, traveling this harsh land?
            </p>

            <p id="1-5-1" class="intextholder">
              The kingdom of darkness, the home of the wicked and the dangerous.
              A place where death and treasure is around every corner, and at
              the heart of it all is the black fortress, home to the dark ruler
              and source of the shadow creeping across the land. Feels kind of
              like skipping straight to the final act, but it will be an
              experience like no other.
            </p>
            <p id="1-5-2" class="intextholder">
              Now I just need to decide through whose eyes I will see it from.
            </p>

            <p id="2-1-1" class="intextholder">
              It’s important to stay humble, and being a part of this world is
              going to make me feel special enough just by itself. Who needs to
              save the world when you can have a nice life running a tavern,
              just talking to the residents and listening to the stories of
              travelers.
            </p>
            <p id="2-1-2" class="intextholder">
              But who shall I be more specifically? That tavern idea seemed
              nice, let’s go with that!
            </p>

            <p id="2-2-1" class="intextholder">
              Of course, “The Hero of Legend, the warrior chosen to defeat the
              darkness and bring light back to the land.” A tale as old as time,
              but one I am happy to take part in. I’ll meet and help many
              people, and at the end I’ll probably fight a god. It’s going to be
              great!
            </p>
            <p id="2-2-2" class="intextholder">
              But let’s throw in a little twist; every great hero needs a
              weakness.
            </p>

            <p id="2-3-1" class="intextholder">
              I don’t need to be important to have a good time. But why would a
              “normal” person be here? Maybe there’s a magic school, where I
              would be a student.
            </p>
            <p id="2-3-2" class="intextholder">
              School might be boring, but magic makes everything more
              interesting, and maybe there’s some dark secret in the school...
              or maybe not, let’s make it a surprise!
            </p>

            <p id="2-4-1" class="intextholder">
              Oh, this is going to be fun! The grand wizard and head of a
              research team at the forefront of their field, hidden away at the
              pole so that they won’t be “disturbed”.
            </p>
            <p id="2-4-2" class="intextholder">
              I wonder how I will further science and what dark secrets I might
              discover.
            </p>

            <p id="2-5-1" class="intextholder">
              Even an average life would be pretty interesting. But what would
              an average life be? Probably that of a soldier, serving their
              country, blind to the cracks in the facade of their homeland.
            </p>
            <p id="2-5-2" class="intextholder">
              Maybe the bloodshed will open their eyes, but what would they do
              once they see the world with these new eyes? Well, not going to
              get anywhere by thinking about it.
            </p>

            <p id="2-6-1" class="intextholder">
              Being important in this place is going to be fun! But who? The
              ruler, the main person in charge, is kind of booring. What else…
              hmmm. There’s probably a rebellion going on, being the leader of
              that would be way cooler!
            </p>
            <p id="2-6-2" class="intextholder">
              A leader who has gained the respect of their peers and risen in
              the ranks, fighting for their fellow people, often getting by on a
              thin thread, because if nothing is risked, nothing will be gained.
            </p>
            <p id="2-6-3" class="intextholder">This is going to be exciting!</p>

            <p id="2-7-1" class="intextholder">
              I’m thinking something like a trader, traveling this land with my
              caravan, searching for wares and coin.
            </p>
            <p id="2-7-2" class="intextholder">
              Maybe we’ll run into some peculiar customers, maybe we’ll run into
              some peculiar goods, maybe nothing will happen at all. In any
              case, I’m sure I’ll have some fun with it. Haggling always did
              seem kind of fun.
            </p>

            <p id="2-8-1" class="intextholder">
              Like an explorer, searching for fame, glory, and of course, a bit
              of money wouldn’t hurt. Adventure is around every corner, I’ll
              just have to look, and I’ll meet a lot of people to help me or
              lead me astray, and maybe a tempel, filled with great treasure and
              deadly traps.
            </p>
            <p id="2-8-2" class="intextholder">
              But even if I find nothing, I’m sure I’ll have some fun, after
              all, the search for adventure is an adventure in itself, is it
              not?
            </p>

            <p id="2-9-1" class="intextholder">
              So, a minion? Just, a regular minion? Like a goblin or something?
              No, that’s boring, they barely even think for themselves. What
              about… oh? Yeah, yeah that could work. This will be…
            </p>

            <p id="2-10-1" class="intextholder">
              What important people are there in the kingdom of darkness? There
              is… The dark ruler. Being evil isn’t something I enjoy, but every
              point of view is important, and maybe they’re not as evil as
              people believe.
            </p>
            <p id="2-10-2" class="intextholder">
              “The road to hell is paved with good intentions”, I wonder which
              will pave mine.
