        Being important in this place is going to be fun! But who? The ruler,
        the main person in charge, is kind of booring. What else… hmmm. There’s
        probably a rebellion going on, being the leader of that would be way
        cooler!

      <p class="text">
        A leader who has gained the respect of their peers and risen in the
        ranks, fighting for their fellow people, often getting by on a thin
        thread, because if nothing is risked, nothing will be gained.
